This is library implementing Reticulum protocol in Elixir

## Submodules

`./Reticulum/` submodule serves as read-only reference for Reticulim protocol implementation. This library is the source of truth for correct protocol behavior
`./lxmf/` submodule serves as read-only reference for LXMF protocol implementation. This library is the source of truth for correct protocol behavior

`./reticulum_ex/` submodule serves as read-only reference of different Elixir reticulum library. This is not state of the art or reference but can contain useful patterns we can draw inspiration from and inform our decisions

## Verification

You must run `mix check` and fix any issues it reports before declaring any coding task as finished
